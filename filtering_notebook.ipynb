    "To ensure safety on highways and a smooth traffic flow, road inspectors are  important. When accidents occur, they appear and make sure that the traffic can quickly resume. It is important for these people to show up as soon as possible when accidents happen. So, an optimal distribution of the inspectors to make sure that they will arrive shortly after the accident is necessary.\n",

For reaching this objective the following research question(s) are proposed. <br><br><b>Main Research Question:</b> What would be the optimal location of road inspectors in the Netherlands, such that travel times to incidents are minimized?\n",

    "<b> Version Control: </b>Git and GitHub will be used for code tracking and collaboration.\n",
