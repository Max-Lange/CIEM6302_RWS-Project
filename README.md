# CIEM6302_RWS-Project
This is the branch of group 1 from the RWS Project. 

This project has a main goal of creating an algorithm for locating road inspector in the network in such a way that driving time to incidents is minimised.

People who are interested in our search for a decent working algorithm and our conclusions, could read the final notebook named 'final_notebook.ipynb'. 
There are some scripts used in the final notebook which could be read by people who are more interested in the details of the process to the final conclusions. People who are interested in how the data is filtered could look to the data filtering function which is named 'data_filtering.py'. People who are interested how the function to convert data from the Dutch RD system to the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84), could take a look to the code 'projection_conversion.py'. People who are interested in the code which is used to visualize the data could take a look to the data visualizing function which is named 'visualize.py'. People who are interested in how the probabilities of the road segments used in the algorithm have been calculated could look to the code 'node_probability.py'. People who are more interested in how the plot with the number of inspectors against the traveltime based on the created algoritm is made, could take a look to the code named 'inspectornr_vs_traveltime.py'. People who are more interested in how the function to validate the results is created, could look to the code 'validation.py'. 

The pages of the streamlit application are sorted in the 'Pages' folder which includes the pages of the 'Research', 'Visualise data', 'Maps', 'Spatio-temporal', 'Algorithm - Full Dataset', 'Algorithm - Variable Dataset', 'Evaluation' and 'Conclusion'. People who are interested in the code of the streamlit application could take a look to this folder.
